# Spaceship Titanic
This notebook features a solution to the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" challenge available on Kaggle. The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was taken from Kaggle, an online data science platform that offers public and private datasets, as well as tools for data analysis and modeling. The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data.

## Exploratory data analysis
Initially, I performed an exploratory analysis of the data to understand the distribution of classes and the relationship between the different variables in the dataset. Then, I cleaned the data, treating missing values and selecting the most relevant variables for the model.

## Model training
I used the GradientBoostingClassifier model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The model was trained with the training data and validated with the test data. The model accuracy reached 81%, which indicates a good performance in the classification task.

## Results
The trained model can be used to predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic with reasonable accuracy. This type of model can be useful to better understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers and to inform safety policies in sea travel.
